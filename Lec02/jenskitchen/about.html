        <h1>About Jenâ€™s Kitchen</h1>
        <p>
            The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some
            cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over
            time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. <i>Bon Appetit!</i> 
        </p>
        <p>
            The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One
            day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
